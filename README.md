GNU Units in the browser, for all those poor people who don't have it installed 
on their machines. Implementation (WASI + WASM) was sufficiently painful that 
I'm not going to brag about it or recommend similar projects.

WASM/WASI framework was forked (and very heavily modified) from 
[1](wasi-fs-access).
